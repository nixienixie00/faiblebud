- Alexa speakers is everywhere, there are over 100 million Alexa enabled devices. All mobilephones can also use Alexa via
Alexa app. Alexa Auto allows you to use Alexa in your car. Alexa is also available on many other devices such as TVs, etc.

# Market Potential

You can use this at home or even on the move in the car, etc!

There are over 100 million Alexa enabled devices out there and many times more users per device.

# Testing

Currently the Alexa Skill is in development mode and is not yet published. To test the skill, you need to be added as a beta tester.
Please contact the author to be added as a beta tester.

The full experience can only be tested on an Alexa device. However, you can test the backend server using simple instructions below.

# Features

Up to the 7 different voices to listen to so the young ones don't get bored

# Architecture

The Alexa Skill is currently created by VoiceFlow no-code platform. The backend is a NodeJS server whose source code is in this repo
whose primary function is to make calls to the ElevenLabs API to generate the audio narration.

# Alexa Backend Server

The Alexa front end skill (created in Voiceflow) utilizes this backend server to handle the following:

- Synthetizing of text to speech using the Eleven Labs API and returning back an AUDIO data URI
- Easy testing and experimenting with different settings to generate the best audio output
- Once the audio is generated by Eleven Labs, it is processed in real time to the format that can be played on Alexa devices and stored in an AWS S3 Bucket

## Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your machine

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/goldzulu/faiblebud.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory:

   ```
   cd faiblebud
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Replace `your_api_key_here` in the `.env.template` file with your Eleven Labs API key.

   ```
   ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   PORT=3000
   ```

5. Rename the `.env.template` file to `.env`.


## Running the Backend Server

Run the following command in the project directory:

```
npm start
```

The server will start listening on the specified port (default is 3000). You can now make a POST request to the `/synthesize` endpoint with the text and voice settings as input.

## API Endpoint

**POST** `/synthesize`

**Request Body:**

- text(required): The text to synthesize.
- voice (optional): The voice to use for synthesis. Default is '21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM'.
- voice_settings (optional): An object containing additional voice settings.
  - stability (default: 0)
  - similarity_boost (default: 0)

**Response:**

Returns an object containing the synthesized audio in a data URI format.

```json
{
  "audioDataURI": "data:audio/mpeg;base64,..."
}
```

## Example Request

```bash
curl -X POST -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"text": "Hello, world!", "voice": "21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM", "voice_settings": {"stability": 0, "similarity_boost": 0}}' \
  http://localhost:3000/synthesize
```

## Example Response

```json
{
  "audioDataURI": "data:audio/mpeg;base64,//uQZAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
}
```
